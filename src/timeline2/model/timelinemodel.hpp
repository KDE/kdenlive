/* @brief This class represents a Timeline object, as viewed by the backend.
   In general, the Gui associated with it will send modification queries (such as resize or move), and this class authorize them or not depending on the
   validity of the modifications.

   This class also serves to keep track of all objects. It holds pointers to all tracks and clips, and gives them unique IDs on creation. These Ids are used in
   any interactions with the objects and have nothing to do with Melt IDs.

   This is the entry point for any modifications that has to be made on an element. The dataflow beyond this entry point may vary, for example when the user
   request a clip resize, the call is deferred to the clip itself, that check if there is enough data to extend by the requested amount, compute the new in and
   out, and then asks the track if there is enough room for extension. To avoid any confusion on which function to call first, rembember to always call the
   version in timeline. This is also required to generate the Undo/Redo operators

   The undo/redo system is designed around lambda functions. Each time a function executes an elementary change to the model, it writes the corresponding
   operation and its reverse, respectively in the redo and the undo lambdas. This way, if an operation fails for some reason, we can easily cancel the steps
   that have been done so far without corrupting anything. The other advantage is that operations are easy to compose, and you get a undo/redo pair for free no
   matter in which way you combine them.

   Most of the modification functions are named requestObjectAction. Eg, if the object is a clip and we want to move it, we call requestClipMove. These
   functions always return a bool indicating success, and when they return false they should guarantee than nothing has been modified. Most of the time, these
   functions come in two versions: the first one is the entry point if you want to perform only the action (and not compose it with other actions). This version
   will generally automatically push and Undo object on the Application stack, in case the user later wants to cancel the operation. It also generally goes the
   extra mile to ensure the operation is done in a way that match the user's expectation: for example requestClipMove checks whether the clip belongs to a group
   and in that case actually mouves the full group. The other version of the function, if it exists, is intended for composition (using the action as part of a
   complex operation). It takes as input the undo/redo lambda corresponding to the action that is being performed and accumulates on them. Note that this
   version does the minimal job: in the example of the requestClipMove, it will not move the full group if the clip is in a group.

   Generally speaking, we don't check ahead of time if an action is going to succeed or not before applying it.
   We just apply it naively, and if it fails at some point, we use the undo operator that we are constructing on the fly to revert what we have done so far.
   For example, when we move a group of clips, we apply the move operation to all the clips inside this group (in the right order). If none fails, we are good,
   otherwise we revert what we've already done.
   This kind of behaviour frees us from the burden of simulating the actions before actually applying theme. This is a good thing because this simulation step
   would be very sensitive to corruptions and small discrepancies, which we try to avoid at all cost.


   It derives from AbstractItemModel (indirectly through TimelineItemModel) to provide the model to the QML interface. An itemModel is organized with row and
   columns that contain the data. It can be hierarchical, meaning that a given index (row,column) can contain another level of rows and column.
   Our organization is as follows: at the top level, each row contains a track. These rows are in the same order as in the actual timeline.
   Then each of this row contains itself sub-rows that correspond to the clips.
   Here the order of these sub-rows is unrelated to the chronological order of the clips,
   but correspond to their Id order. For example, if you have three clips, with ids 12, 45 and 150, they will receive row index 0,1 and 2.
   This is because the order actually doesn't matter since the clips are rendered based on their positions rather than their row order.
   The id order has been chosen because it is consistent with a valid ordering of the clips.
   The columns are never used, so the data is always in column 0

   An ModelIndex in the ItemModel consists of a row number, a column number, and a parent index. In our case, tracks have always an empty parent, and the clip
   have a track index as parent.
   A ModelIndex can also store one additional integer, and we exploit this feature to store the unique ID of the object it corresponds to.
