Kdenlive Installation Instrucions
=================================


To compile and install, go in the source directory and type:

mkdir build;cd build
cmake ..
(If you want to install in a different path, use instead:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path)
make

To install, become root:

sudo make install
(enter root password at prompt)

Once installed, you can start Kdenlive by typing "kdenlive".

Note that you should also install MLT to do anything useful with Kdenlive. See
the README file for details.

Have Fun!
