About Kdenlive
==============

Kdenlive is a video editing application,
based on MLT Framework and KDE Frameworks 5

Please check the project page for more information:
https://kdenlive.org

Building from source
====================

For more complete instructions see:
https://community.kde.org/Kdenlive/Development

You will first need to install development headers dependencies
from your system (mainly KDE and MLT).

Then in the directory where you extracted the source archive
(with custom /install/path):

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path
make -j4
make install

and then run
/install/path/bin/kdenlive

Alternately, to get kdenlive with an up-to-date multimedia stack
(isolated from your system), you can use the build-kdenlive.sh from:
https://github.com/mltframework/mlt-scripts/
