    <name>Mask Start</name>
    <description>This filter works in conjunction with the mask_apply filter to make filter masking easier. This filter makes a snapshop of the frame before applying a filter, typically one to affect the alpha channel defining the mask. Then, the mask_apply filter uses a transition to composite the current frame's image over the snapshot. The typical use case is to add filters in the following sequence: mask_start, zero or more filters, mask_apply.</description>
