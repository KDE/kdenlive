        <comment>The octave shift. This is the octave shift of the source frequency. For example, a shift of +1 would double the frequency; -1 would halve the frequency and 0 would leave the pitch unaffected. To put this in frequency terms, a frequency shift f (where f greater than one for upwards shift and less than one for downwards) is: o = log(f) / log(2). Ignored if pitchscale is set.</comment>
