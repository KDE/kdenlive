    <name>Nikon D90 Stairstepping fix</name>
    <description>Removes stairstepping artifacts from Nikon D90's 720p videos.
        Sharp lines in videos from the Nikon D90 show steps each 8th or 9th line, assumedly
        due to poor downsampling. These can be smoothed out with this filter if they become too annoying.
