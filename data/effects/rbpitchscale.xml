        <comment>The pitch scaling ratio. This is the ratio of target frequency to source frequency. For example, a ratio of 2.0 would shift up by one octave; 0.5 down by one octave; or 1.0 leave the pitch unaffected. To put this in musical terms, a pitch scaling ratio corresponding to a shift of o octaves (where o is positive for an upwards shift and negative for downwards) is: f = pow(2.0, o). Overrides octaveshift.</comment>
